## Architecture
The story teller can deal with the story of "Someone Do SomeThing", the LLM part complete the cause, process and result,
and the Stable-Diffusion part draw images for them. <br/>
* ‚Äôüé•üí¨ Book Cover Story Teller‚Äò can add book cover to the story (click from left image gallery), and all the image are transformed to the cover style.
* ‚Äòüß± Pixel Story Teller‚Äô can downsampling the image to pixel style, make the output like shot from pixel games.
